# Problem Statements
## 1. Regression (Forecasting & Trends)

- “Can we predict the number of crimes that will occur in a given month in Los Angeles using past data, area, and premise information?”
- “Does the time of day (hour) significantly influence crime frequency, and can we build a regression model to predict hourly crime counts?”
- “Can victim demographics (age, sex, descent) improve the accuracy of predicting monthly crime volumes across different areas?”

## 2. Binary Classification

- “Can we classify whether an arrest will be made for a reported crime, based on factors such as crime type, time, area, and victim demographics?”
- “Can we distinguish between violent and non-violent crimes using structured data such as weapon type, premise, and crime category?”
- “Can we predict whether a crime will involve a weapon or not, given the premise, area, and time of occurrence?”

## 3. Multi-Class Classification

- “Can we accurately predict the type of crime (e.g., theft, assault, burglary, fraud, vandalism) based on temporal (hour, month), spatial (area, premise), and victim information?”
- “Can we predict the police area (jurisdiction) where a crime is most likely to occur based on its characteristics?”
- “How accurately can machine learning models classify crimes into their legal codes or grouped categories using historical data?”

## 4. Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

- “Can a feedforward neural network outperform traditional ML models in predicting monthly crime counts?”
- “Can deep neural networks classify crimes into multiple categories (theft, assault, burglary, etc.) more effectively than Decision Trees or SVM?”
- “Can we use spatial data (latitude & longitude) to generate crime hotspot heatmaps and train CNNs to detect high-risk areas?”

## 5. Clustering & Anomaly Detection

- “Can unsupervised clustering group police areas into distinct crime zones based on type, frequency, and timing of crimes?”
- “Can anomaly detection techniques identify unusual spikes in crime (crime waves) in certain areas/months compared to historical patterns?”
- “Can PCA help in reducing high-dimensional categorical features and reveal hidden clusters of crime patterns?”

## 6. Ensemble & Probabilistic Models

- “Can ensemble methods (Bagging/Boosting) improve prediction accuracy of crime categories compared to single classifiers?”
- “Can Naive Bayes or GMM effectively model the probability distribution of different crime types and victim profiles?”
- “How do generative classifiers compare with discriminative classifiers for predicting crime categories?”
