## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze crime data from Los Angeles to uncover patterns and, where possible, build a predictive model to forecast crime occurrences. The project covers:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand crime trends by category, location, and time  
- Visualization of temporal and spatial patterns  
- Regression / predictive modeling to estimate crime occurrence or trends  

---

## Dataset

- **`LA_Crime_dataset.csv`** — the primary dataset used for analysis  
- **`regression dataset/`** — contains derived/processed data used for modeling  

The data includes (but may not be limited to) crime incident types, locations (e.g. neighborhoods or coordinates), timestamps, and related features.
